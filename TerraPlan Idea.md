# TerraPlan: Smart Land-Use Intelligence Platform for Africa

---

## Introduction  
TerraPlan is a pan-African digital platform that brings **smart land-use intelligence** to citizens, businesses and governments. In essence, it will be a “Google Maps” for land potential—combining satellite Earth Observation, IoT sensor feeds and socio-economic data into an interactive map and analytics tool.  

This aligns with GAIAthon ’24’s mission of fusing EO and IoT skills for sustainability, and supports Africa’s Agenda 2063 by promoting data-driven, inclusive development. TerraPlan builds on initiatives like **Digital Earth Africa**—which “aims to improve the lives of people across Africa by translating Earth observations into insights”—by tailoring such insights to everyday land-use decisions.  

> In a continent poised to nearly double its population by 2050, smarter land planning is critical. TerraPlan fills the gap between rich geospatial data and on-the-ground planners, ensuring that growth is sustainable, resilient and people-centered.

## Problem Definition  

Satellite analysis shows that Africa has been a hotspot of **unchecked cropland expansion**: nearly **79 %** of new farmland (2003–2019) came from natural forests and grasslands. This trend—driven by rising population and demand—is unsustainable without better planning. Across the continent, urban areas are swelling into informal settlements, often outpacing infrastructure. For example, Nairobi’s population doubled in 30 years and today **60 %** of residents occupy just **6 %** of the land (mainly slums). Such rapid growth strains services and encroaches on ecosystems. Meanwhile, climate risks loom large: floods and droughts have displaced millions in recent years.

> _On average, ~1.9 million people per year could be displaced by floods or drought in the Horn of Africa under current climate conditions._

### Key Challenges  
- **Urban sprawl & informal settlements**  
  Rapid settlement conversion destroys green space and creates hazards (flooding, landslides).

- **Unsustainable agriculture & land degradation**  
  Vast new farms are cleared, risking soil exhaustion and biodiversity loss. Farmers lack fine-scale soil, climate and water data to choose the best crops.

- **Disaster & climate risk**  
  Without predictive planning, extreme events overwhelm communities. Over **32 million** Africans displaced by floods since 2008; droughts have forced millions more to move.

- **Governance & data gaps**  
  Local governments often lack up-to-date maps and demographic data.  
  > “Evidence-based land use plans are not created…due to…technical barriers (lack of quality, up-to-date data).”

## Use-Case Scenarios  

1. **Government planners & policymakers**  
   - Overlay population density (e.g., WorldPop grids) with hazard maps (flood zones, landslide risk) and environmental layers.  
   - Example: Reroute development away from mapped floodplains and target service upgrades in growing suburbs.

2. **Agribusinesses & farmers**  
   - Identify optimal farming zones by filtering for soil fertility, rainfall history and NDVI vegetation cover.  
   - Example: Use DE Africa’s **Cropland Extent 2019** (10 m resolution) and multiyear NDVI anomalies to highlight under-utilized but productive land.

3. **Conservation & environment agencies**  
   - Set buffer zones by combining land-cover change data (Sentinel/Landsat) with human-footprint layers (roads, settlements).  
   - Example: Alert when a road is slated through a key forest area or farmland creeps into critical watersheds.

4. **Real estate & infrastructure developers**  
   - Screen parcels by flood-inundation layers (DE Africa’s Water Observations from Space), shallow water tables, and proximity to power/roads.  
   - Example: Avoid flood-prone or swampy land, ensuring sites are near markets and labor.

5. **Individuals & smallholders**  
   - Draw a radius around a village to list available plots with data on soil type (OpenLandMap), historic rainfall and service access.  
   - Example: Families planning relocation query for low-risk areas with sufficient schools, clinics and jobs.

## Sectoral Impact Areas  

- **Agriculture**  
  Precision farming at scale: NDVI, moisture indices and soil maps forecast yields and advise crop choices. Alerts for droughts and pests improve food security.

- **Urban Development**  
  Evidence-based sprawl control: overlay growth maps on terrain and infrastructure to reserve green belts and plan transit lines. Integrate heat-island and pollution data for resilient cities.

- **Energy & Infrastructure**  
  Site renewable projects using solar insolation, wind potential and grid-network layers. Plan water/irrigation schemes with subsoil and hydrology data.

- **Environment & Natural Resources**  
  Early warning for deforestation and habitat loss. Quantitative trade-offs between development and ecosystem services preserve high-value areas.

- **Tourism & Recreation**  
  Map natural and cultural assets with connectivity and risk overlays for eco-friendly lodges and corridors.

- **Waste Management**  
  Highlight low-density areas far from water sources and transport for dumps/recycling. Account for wind and flood data to avoid new hazards.

## Data Sources & Technologies  

- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**: Cloud platform for decades of satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS).  
- **Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa)**: Analysis-ready Earth observation data cube.  
- **WorldPop & UN GPW**: High-resolution population and demographic layers.  
- **Sentinel-1/2, Landsat 8/9, MODIS**: Multispectral and radar datasets.  
- **OpenLandMap, SoilGrids, CHIRPS**: Soil texture, fertility and climate normals.  
- **OpenStreetMap, Global Forest Watch, WDPA**: Infrastructure, forest loss and protected area boundaries.  
- **IoT & ground sensors**: LoRaWAN networks, Netatmo stations, crowdsourced readings.  
- **Development tools**: Python (geopandas, rasterio, xarray, EO-Learn), QGIS/GRASS, Jupyter, React/Flutter, GEE APIs.

## Value Proposition  

1. **Data-Driven Planning & Risk Reduction**  
   - Shift from intuition to evidence, preventing costly land misuse and reducing disaster exposure.

2. **Inclusive, People-Centered Development**  
   - Democratize data for youth, women and smallholders—aligns with Agenda 2063’s equity goals.

3. **Sustainability & Conservation**  
   - Balance development with ecosystem services, supporting SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger), 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).

4. **Economic Efficiency & Resilience**  
   - Guide investments to high-yield, low-risk lands; optimize infrastructure for maximum social impact.

5. **Innovation & Feasibility**  
   - Prototype within weeks using mature open-source platforms and public APIs; scalable across borders.

## Pitch Context  

> “Imagine a digital land charter for Africa—where every citizen, farmer and planner can query the right location for housing, farming or conservation with the tap of a smartphone.”

TerraPlan offers a visionary yet practical solution, leveraging Google Earth Engine, Digital Earth Africa and IoT feeds to empower data-driven land-use decisions. Its integration of satellite, sensor and socio-economic layers makes it novel in the African context and directly aligned with GAIAthon ’24’s themes of sustainability, EO/IoT fusion and youth empowerment.
